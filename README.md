## About Me

Hey there! I’m Ezra. I’ve got a bachelor degree in Information Technology from Bulacan State University and have been diving into the world of manual and automation testing for the past five years. I love making sure software runs smoothly and finding creative solutions to tricky problems.

When I’m not working, you might find me reading books, watching movies and tv shows. I’m all about staying curious and keeping up with the latest tech trends, so I’m always up for a good tech chat or learning something new.
